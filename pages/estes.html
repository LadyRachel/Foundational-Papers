<h4>The main methods involved field observations at Amchitka Island (Rat Island group) with a high-density sea otter population and Shemya Island (Near Island group) where sea otters were largely absent. Researchers collected data on vegetation coverage and sea urchin density at different depths, they also examined the size class distribution and biomass of sea urchins in both locations. The key finding was that sea otters exert strong control over herbivorous sea urchin populations. </h4>
