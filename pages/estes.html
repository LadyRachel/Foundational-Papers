<h4>The paper by Estes and Palmisano in 1974 explores sea otter as a keystone species and the trophic cascade that occurred upon losing these mammals in kelp and sea urchins. The main methods involved field observations at Amchitka Island (Rat Island group) that had a high-density of sea otter population as well as at Shemya Island (Near Island group) where sea otters were largely absent. Researchers collected data on vegetation coverage and sea urchin density at different depths, they also examined the size class distribution and biomass of sea urchins in both locations. The key finding by Estes and Palmisano was that sea otters exert strong control over herbivorous sea urchin populations. </h4>
