#Hamilton proposes an extension of classical theory centered on a **gene-centric view of evolution**, arguing that a gene for altruistic behavior can spread if the benefit to relatives, who have an increased chance of carrying the same gene, outweighs the cost to the altruist. This is mathematically expressed as **k > 1/r (or k > -r in the text)**, where k is the ratio of benefit to the relative over the cost to the altruist, and r is **Sewall Wright's Coefficient of Relationship. The paper suggests that altruism towards closer relatives is more likely to evolve, and altruism towards unrelated individuals is only expected when the risk is very slight and the average neighbor is not too distantly related**
