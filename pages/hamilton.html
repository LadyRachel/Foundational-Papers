<h4>Hamilton’s 1963 paper extends the classical theory of evolution by focusing on a gene-centric view, arguing that a gene for altruistic behavior can spread if the benefit to relatives, who have an increased chance of carrying the same gene, outweighs the cost to the altruist. The study addresses previously limitations in natural selection in explaining how altruistic behavior is maintained as the expense of the individual performing the behavior should naturally fall out of the gene pool. This is mathematically expressed, as seen in the image above, as k > 1/r, where k is the ratio of benefit to the relative over the cost to the altruist, and r is Sewall Wright's Coefficient of Relationship. The paper suggests that altruism towards closer relatives is more likely to evolve, and altruism towards unrelated individuals is only expected when the risk is very small, and the average neighbor is closely related. </h4>
