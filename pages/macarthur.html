# This study investigated the population ecology of five warbler species in northeastern coniferous forests to understand how they coexist despite their similar ecological preferences. Key findings revealed that the five warbler species **partition resources through differences in their feeding ecology**, including where they forage in trees (height and branch location) and how they obtain food (peering, hawking, hovering, movement patterns). Furthermore, they exhibit **differences in nest site selection and the timing of their breeding seasons**, which may correspond to peak insect abundance in their respective feeding zones. The study also provides evidence for **density-dependent population regulation** and the role of **territoriality** in managing local densities
