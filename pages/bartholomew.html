<h4>This paper elaborates on a previously outlined verbal model, grounding it in observable behavior. The paper posits that pinnipeds' unique combination of offshore feeding and terrestrial breeding interacts with general mammalian traits to favor polygynous social structures and pronounced sexual dimorphism. This model highlights the roles of gregariousness, male territoriality, and physiological adaptations like large size and fat stores, further exploring feedback loops that reinforce these traits and considering adjustments in females and pups to this system.</h4>
