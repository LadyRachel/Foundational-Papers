<h4>This paper by Bartholomew published in 1970 examines the interactions among pinnipeds, explicitly discussing the polygynous social structure of elephant seals and sea lions. This paper elaborates on a previously outlined verbal model, supporting it in observable behavior. The paper suggests that pinnipeds' unique combination of offshore feeding and terrestrial breeding along with general mammalian traits merge together to favor polygynous social structures and the pronounced sexual dimorphism between the males and females of these animals. This study highlights the roles of gregariousness, male territoriality, and physiological adaptations like large size and fat stores, stating that these could be some of the feedback loops to reinforce these traits in this system. </h4>
