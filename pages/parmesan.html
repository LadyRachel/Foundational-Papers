# The study conducted a global meta-analysis on over 1,700 species to assess the biological impacts of climate change. The researchers used statistical meta-analyses and categorical analyses to identify trends in species’ responses. They focused on range shifts and phenological (timing) changes, ensuring that the data controlled for non-climatic confounding factors. The meta-analysis included only multi-species studies that reported neutral or negative results alongside positive ones to mitigate publication bias.

The main findings revealed that species have shifted their ranges by an average of 6.1 km per decade toward the poles or meters per decade upward. Additionally, the timing of spring events has advanced by 2.3 days per decade. The researchers also introduced the concept of a “diagnostic fingerprint” of climate change, characterized by consistent sign-switching patterns in species’ responses across time and space. Among species with long-term datasets, 84% displayed trends consistent with climate change predictions. The study concluded with “very high confidence” (as defined by the IPCC) that climate change is already affecting living systems on a global scale.
