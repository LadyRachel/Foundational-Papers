<h4>This study by Parmesan and Yohe from 2003 conducted a global meta-analysis on over 1,700 species to assess the biological impacts of climate change. The researchers used statistical meta-analyses and categorical analyses to identify trends in responses across different species. The focus was specifically on range shifts and phenological (timing) changes, ensuring that the data was controlled for possibly confounding non-climatic factors. The meta-analysis included only multi-species studies that reported neutral or negative results alongside positive ones in an attempt to mitigate possible publication bias. The main findings of Parmesan and Yohe revealed that species have shifted their ranges by an average of 6.1 km per decade toward the poles. Additionally, the timing of spring events has moved up by 2.3 days per decade. The researchers also introduced the idea of a “diagnostic fingerprint” of climate change, which are the consistent sign-switching patterns in responses of species across time and space. Among species with long-term datasets examined, 84% displayed trends consistent with climate change predictions. The study concluded with “very high confidence” (as defined by the IPCC) that climate change is already affecting living systems on a global scale. </h4>The main findings revealed that species have shifted their ranges by an average of 6.1 km per decade toward the poles or meters per decade upward. Additionally, the timing of spring events has advanced by 2.3 days per decade. The researchers also introduced the concept of a “diagnostic fingerprint” of climate change, characterized by consistent sign-switching patterns in species’ responses across time and space. Among species with long-term datasets, 84% displayed trends consistent with climate change predictions. The study concluded with “very high confidence” (as defined by the IPCC) that climate change is already affecting living systems on a global scale.</h4>
