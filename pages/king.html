<h4>The paper "Dr. Koch’s Postulates" (1952) by King discusses the principles formed by Robert Koch for identifying the causal agents of infectious diseases. A causal agent is (in this case a pathogen) that directly contributes to causing a particular effect or condition. The main methods involved a review of Koch’s original experiments, and the refinements of his ideas made in light of more advanced more modern microbiological techniques. King’s key findings are that we need to continue to make modifications to Koch’s postulates, especially since we now know of things like asymptomatic carriers and obligate intracellular pathogens that do not always conform to the original criteria. </h4>
