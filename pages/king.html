# The study discusses how Koch's postulates have been used to confirm microbial causation and evaluates their limitations in light of modern microbiological techniques. The main methods involved a review of Kochâ€™s original experiments and subsequent refinements made as scientific techniques advanced. Key findings highlight the necessity of modifications to the postulates, especially with the advent of asymptomatic carriers and obligate intracellular pathogens that do not always conform to the original criteria.
