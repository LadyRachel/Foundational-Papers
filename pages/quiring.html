<h4> Quiring et al. (1994) investigated the genetic involvement of eye development by analyzing the <i>eyeless</i> gene in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> and homologs of the gene found in other species. Using molecular cloning, sequence comparisons, and functional analysis performed by transgenic experiments, Quiring demonstrated that the gene <i>eyeless</i> is homologous to the vertebrate <i>Pax-6</i> gene. The key finding from this study was that eyeless/Pax-6 acts as a master control gene for eye formation and this was proved as expression in <i>Drosophila</i> induced the formation of eyes in non-ocular (without eyes normally) tissues. This discovery provided strong evidence for the deep evolutionary conservation of eye development mechanisms across animal phyla. </h4>
