<h2> Quiring et al. (1994) investigated the genetic basis of eye development by analyzing the eyeless gene in Drosophila melanogaster and its homologs in other species. Using molecular cloning, sequence comparisons, and functional analysis through transgenic experiments, they demonstrated that eyeless is homologous to the vertebrate Pax-6 gene. The key finding was that eyeless/Pax-6 acts as a master control gene for eye formation, as ectopic expression in Drosophila induced the formation of eyes in non-ocular tissues. This discovery provided strong evidence for the deep evolutionary conservation of eye development mechanisms across animal phyla.
