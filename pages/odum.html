<h4>Eugene P. Odum’s “The Strategy of Ecosystem Development” (1969) presents a model of ecological succession by combining data from various ecosystems. Odum analyzed trends in energy flow, biomass accumulation, nutrient cycling, and species interactions across different successional stages by comparing them. The findings indicate that ecosystems develop relatively predictably but rapidly from immature, to mature, stable ones. When in early successional stages, ecosystems generally have high gross production but inefficient energy use, nutrient cycles with significant points of loss, and generally low biodiversity. As succession develops, ecosystems become more efficient with better energy flow, nutrient retention, and increased biodiversity and complexity. Mature ecosystems, Odum says, are in a state of homeostasis, with greater reliance on detritus-based energy flow, and nutrient cycling that stays within the ecosystem, thus leading to greater stability and resilience. </h4>
