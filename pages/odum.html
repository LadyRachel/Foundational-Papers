# Eugene P. Odum’s “The Strategy of Ecosystem Development” (1969) presents a conceptual model of ecological succession by synthesizing data from various ecosystems. Using a comparative approach, Odum analyzed trends in energy flow, biomass accumulation, nutrient cycling, and species interactions across different successional stages. His findings indicate that ecosystems develop predictably from immature, rapidly changing states to mature, stable ones. Early successional stages exhibit high gross production but inefficient energy use, open nutrient cycles with significant losses, and low biodiversity. As succession progresses, ecosystems become more efficient, optimizing energy flow, enhancing nutrient retention, and increasing biodiversity and complexity. Mature ecosystems exhibit homeostasis, greater reliance on detritus-based energy flow, and tighter nutrient cycling, leading to greater stability and resilience.
