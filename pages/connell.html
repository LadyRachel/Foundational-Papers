<h4>“Diversity in Tropical Rain Forests and Coral Reefs” investigates the ecological mechanisms that allow for such a wide array of species to coexist in **tropical rain forests and coral reefs. Connell discusses the processes that maintain and promote species richness.** 
Using long-term observational studies and experimental manipulations, Connell proposed the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis (IDH), which suggests that species diversity is highest at moderate levels of disturbance.</h4>
