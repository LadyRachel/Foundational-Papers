<h4>In Connell’s 1978 paper <i>Diversity in Tropical Rain Forests and Coral Reefs</i> he explores the ecological factors that help support the incredible variety of species found in highly biodiverse areas like tropical rainforests and coral reefs. Connell discusses some of the processes that encourage or promote as well as maintain the existing species richness in these ecosystems. Using a combination of long-term observational studies and some direct experiments, Connell introduced the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis (IDH). This theory suggests that species diversity is highest at moderate levels of disturbance. This paper encouraged much more research to be done on the influence of disturbance on ecosystems. </h4>
