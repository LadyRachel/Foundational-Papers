<h4>David Starr Jordan's 1908 paper, *The Law of Geminate Species*, explores how geographical isolation drives speciation. The paper formalizes "Jordan’s Law," which states that the closest related species to any given species is not found in the same region but rather in a neighboring area separated by a physical barrier. Jordan highlights the role of segregation in preventing interbreeding, allowing for divergence through heredity, variation, and selection. A major focus of the study is geminate species—pairs of closely related species separated by barriers such as oceans or mountain ranges. The paper provides numerous examples, including fish species on either side of the Isthmus of Panama, which diverged following the landmass's formation in the Miocene. Jordan argues that isolation is a crucial factor in maintaining species distinctions and applies his theory to both animals and plants, though he acknowledges that plant distributions are more complex due to factors like climate and soil suitability.</h4>
