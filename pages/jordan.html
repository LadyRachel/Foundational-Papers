<h4>David Starr Jordan's 1908, <i>The Law of Geminate Species</i>, discussed how geographical isolation can create speciation. The paper introduced "Jordan’s Law," a theory that states that the closest related species will not be found in the same region but rather in a neighboring area that is completely separated and isolated by a physical barrier. Jordan emphasized that segregation prevents interbreeding, which allows for divergence through heredity, subsequent variation, and selection. A major focus of the study is geminate (twin) species—pairs of closely related species separated by large physical barriers like oceans or mountain ranges. The paper provides numerous examples, including fish species on either side of the Isthmus of Panama, which diverged following the landmass's formation in the Miocene. Jordan argues that isolation is a critical factor in maintaining separate species and applies “Jordan’s Law” to both animals and plants, though he acknowledges that plant distributions are much more complex. </h4>
