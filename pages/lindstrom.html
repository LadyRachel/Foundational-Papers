# **laboratory experiments on captive populations, observational studies of wild populations, cross-fostering experiments to disentangle genetic and environmental influences, and long-term data collection on individuals to assess fitness consequences**

Key findings reveal that **conditions experienced during early development can have profound effects on various aspects of an individual's phenotype, including growth, metabolism, immunocompetence, and even later reproductive success and survival**

These early conditions can also lead to **cohort effects**, where individuals born in the same period share similar life-history trajectories due to shared environmental experiences
the review discusses how these early developmental effects influence **population dynamics and the evolution of life-history strategies**, including parental responses to fluctuating environments and the potential for trade-offs between parental investment and their own future survival
