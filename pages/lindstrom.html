<h4>This study by Lindström examines early development in birds and mammals, focusing on key developmental processes and comparative aspects between these two groups. Using long-term data collected on embryonic growth rates, physiological adaptations, and ecological influences on early life stages, they assessed fitness consequences. Key findings reveal that conditions experienced during early development can have profound effects on various aspects of an individual's phenotype, including growth, metabolism, immunocompetence, and even later reproductive success and survival. Birds and mammals exhibit distinct, yet convergent developmental trajectories shaped by evolutionary pressures. The early differences in conditions can also lead to cohort effects, where individuals born in the same period share similar life-history trajectories due to shared environmental experiences. The review discusses the potential for trade-offs between parental investment and their offspring’s survival. </h4>
