# Dunn et al. (2008) used phylogenomic methods to construct a comprehensive tree of life, focusing on resolving deep evolutionary relationships among metazoans. The study leveraged large-scale molecular datasets, particularly expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and whole-genome sequences, to improve phylogenetic inference. By employing maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference methods, the researchers reconstructed evolutionary relationships with high statistical support. The key findings revealed new insights into metazoan relationships, including strong support for the placement of ctenophores as a basal lineage, challenging traditional views of early animal evolution. This work provided a refined framework for understanding metazoan diversification and the evolutionary origins of key biological traits.
